# NOTE ==============================================
#
# Fill in code for every method which has a TODO
#
# Your implementation should use the contract (inputs
# and outputs) given for each model, because that is
# what the main script expects. If you modify the contract,
# you must justify that choice, note it in your report, and notify the TAs
# so that we run the correct code.
#
# You may modify the internals of the RNN and GRU classes
# as much as you like, except you must keep the methods
# in each (init_weights_uniform, init_hidden, and forward)
# Using nn.Module and "forward" tells torch which
# parameters are involved in the forward pass, so that it
# can correctly (automatically) set up the backward pass.
#
# You should not modify the interals of the Transformer
# except where indicated to implement the multi-head
# attention.
