# NOTE ==============================================
#
# Fill in code for every method which has a TODO
#
# Your implementation should use the contract (inputs
# and outputs) given for each model, because that is 
# what the main script expects. If you modify the contract, 
# you must justify that choice, note it in your report, and notify the TAs 
# so that we run the correct code.
#
# You may modify the internals of the RNN and GRU classes
# as much as you like, except you must keep the methods
# in each (init_weights_uniform, init_hidden, and forward)
# Using nn.Module and "forward" tells torch which 
# parameters are involved in the forward pass, so that it
# can correctly (automatically) set up the backward pass.
#
# You should not modify the interals of the Transformer
# except where indicated to implement the multi-head
# attention.

# Code for the Transformer model

##############################################################################

"""
Implement the MultiHeadedAttention module of the transformer architecture.
All other necessary modules have already been implemented for you.

We're building a transfomer architecture for next-step prediction tasks, and 
applying it to sequential language modelling. We use a binary "mask" to specify 
which time-steps the model can use for the current prediction.
This ensures that the model only attends to previous time-steps.

The model first encodes inputs using the concatenation of a learned WordEmbedding 
and a (in our case, hard-coded) PositionalEncoding.
The word embedding maps a word's one-hot encoding into a dense real vector.
The positional encoding 'tags' each element of an input sequence with a code that 
identifies it's position (i.e. time-step).

These encodings of the inputs are then transformed repeatedly using multiple
copies of a TransformerBlock.
This block consists of an application of MultiHeadedAttention, followed by a 
standard MLP; the MLP applies *the same* mapping at every position.
Both the attention and the MLP are applied with Resnet-style skip connections, 
and layer normalization.

The complete model consists of the embeddings, the stacked transformer blocks, 
and a linear layer followed by a softmax.
